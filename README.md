Hand Landmark Detection using MediaPipe & Computer Vision
Python License Google Colab

📊 Project Overview
Built a robust computer vision system to detect and visualize hand landmarks in static images with high precision. This end-to-end pipeline leverages Google’s MediaPipe framework and OpenCV to identify 21 anatomical key points on the human hand, enabling applications in gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and augmented reality.

🎯 Key Achievements
🎯 Accurate Detection: Precisely identifies 21 hand landmarks per detected hand
🛠️ Zero Setup: Fully automated environment setup in Google Colab
🖼️ Interactive Input: Seamless image upload and real-time processing
🎨 Visual Clarity: Enhanced visualization with red landmarks and green connection lines
🧪 Research-Ready: Clean, modular code suitable for integration into larger CV systems
🚀 End-to-End Flow: From upload → detection → visualization in under 10 seconds

🛠️ Technical Stack
# Core Libraries
mediapipe, opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, google.colab

# Computer Vision Framework
MediaPipe Hands (Google's state-of-the-art hand tracking solution)

# Key Techniques
Image Upload & Handling, Landmark Detection, BGR-RGB Conversion, Real-Time Drawing, Subplot Visualization

🧠 How It Works
1. Auto-Install Dependencies: Installs mediapipe, opencv, and matplotlib programmatically
2. Upload Images: Users upload one or more hand images via Colab interface
3. Preprocess: Convert BGR to RGB (OpenCV → MediaPipe compatibility)
4. Detect: Run MediaPipe Hands in static mode with confidence threshold (0.5)
5. Annotate: Draw landmarks (red circles) and connections (green lines)
6. Display: Show up to 4 processed images in a clean 2x2 matplotlib grid

🏆 Features Detected
MediaPipe detects 21 3D landmarks per hand:
- Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky joints
- Knuckles and wrist points
- Enables future gesture classification and pose estimation

📈 Visualization Style
- 🔴 Landmark Dots: Red (255, 0, 0), radius = 3
- 🟢 Connection Lines: Green (0, 255, 0), thickness = 2
- Output: High-contrast annotated images ready for presentation

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
✅ No Local Setup: Runs entirely in browser via Google Colab  
✅ Plug-and-Play: Automatic dependency installation  
✅ Visual Impact: Instantly impressive results — perfect for demos  
✅ Foundation for Advanced Projects: Ready to extend to:
   - Sign language recognition
   - Virtual gesture control
   - AR/VR hand interaction
   - Real-time webcam tracking

🧠 Insights & Observations
* Detection Sensitivity: Works best on clear, front-facing hand images
* Lighting Matters: High contrast improves detection accuracy
* Pose Limitations: Extreme angles or occlusions may reduce performance
* Single-Hand Focus: Configured for one hand (max_num_hands=1)

📊 Future Enhancements
- Add handedness detection (Left/Right labeling)
- Export annotated images to disk
- Extend to video input or live webcam
- Integrate with gesture classification (e.g., rock-paper-scissors)
- Add landmark coordinate logging for data analysis

🎯 Real-World Applications
* Assistive Technology: Sign language translation for the hearing impaired
* Human-Computer Interaction: Touchless control systems
* Augmented Reality: Hand integration in AR environments
* Biometrics & Authentication: Hand-based identification
* Gaming: Gesture-driven gameplay mechanics

📚 Skills Demonstrated
* Computer Vision with MediaPipe
* Image Processing using OpenCV
* Google Colab Environment Mastery
* Dynamic Dependency Management
* Visual Data Presentation with Matplotlib
* End-to-End Pipeline Development
* User Interaction in Jupyter Notebooks

💡 Pro Tip: Record a 60-second screen recording showing:
1. Opening the notebook
2. Running the code
3. Uploading hand images
4. Seeing real-time landmarks appear
5. Explaining one application

🎯 This is not just a script — it's a gateway to the future of human-AI interaction.
